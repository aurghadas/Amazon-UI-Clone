# 🛒 Amazon Clone Project

This project is a front-end clone of the **Amazon** homepage, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It replicates the layout, design, and core visual elements of Amazon's interface, including the navigation bar, hero section, product grid, and footer.  

The goal of this project is to practice responsive web design, layout structuring, and styling techniques using pure HTML and CSS. It also integrates **Font Awesome** for iconography and uses a modular image folder for clean asset management.
